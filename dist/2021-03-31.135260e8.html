<p>About a week ago I was diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), Level 1 -- commonly known as &#39;Asperger&#39;s Syndrome&#39;.</p>
<p>I&#39;m still not sure how I feel about the diagnosis, or even if I fully agree with it. Then again, being unsure about how one feels is a common trait among those on the spectrum... Whatever the case may be, I suppose this is a step forward in figuring out what makes me tick.</p>
<p>It is exceedingly rare for anyone to receive <em>only</em> an ASD diagnosis. Usually, the condition comes with so called comorbidities such as ADHD, anxiety, OCD, depression, etc. In my case, the doctors determined I suffer from something called dysthymia -- aka Persistent Depressive Disorder --- which, to put it simply, means I&#39;m somewhat sad most of the time, and very sad some of the time. It&#39;s been like this for me for the past 15-20 years; I had simply accepted this reality as an immutable part of my personality by now. To complicate things further, the psychologist who evaluated me strongly suspected I have something called &#39;intellectual giftedness&#39; which is not a medical condition, but could explain some of my behavior and thought patterns. Determining that, however, would require taking an in-person IQ test and I&#39;m really not convinced it&#39;s worthwhile.</p>
<p>It took me nearly twenty years to get the professional help I need. Twenty years of recurring depression, spiritual torture and suicidal despair. Twenty years of banging my head on the wall trying to figure out why I was feeling this way when everything else in my life seemed to be going well.</p>
<p>In that time I tried all sorts of self-help techniques: Yoga, diets, meditation, sports, drugs, you name it; nothing worked. So why was I so reluctant to seek professional help?<br>I&#39;m not entirely certain myself, but I think a big part of it has to do with internalizing certain toxic views and values such as the Protestant work ethic and notions of masculine invulnerability. (To be clear, I wasn&#39;t raised in a religious or overly patriarchal household; but I think these ideologies permeate Western society and play an important role shaping peoples inner and outer identities) Men are expected to &#39;bite their lip&#39;, &#39;take it on the chin&#39; and &#39;man up&#39; when times get tough. And as much as I loathe that kind of rhetoric, I have to recognize that it forms a substantial part of my self-image and world-view. Of course, not all men take these social expectations quite as seriously, and so the question as to why I didn&#39;t seek help remains to be fully explained.</p>
<p>But better late than never, right? I should add that were it not for my loving partner and their concern and insistence, I might have never taken that step.</p>
<p>After contacting a shrink for the first time last summer. I began taking an antidepressant (cetilopram) for the first time in October. (Not sure how much it&#39;s helped with the dysthymia, but I&#39;m less anxious than I used to be) Now I&#39;ve learned I&#39;m autistic and have begun practical therapy aimed at learning to adapt my life to my condition --- basically, to recognize my strengths and limitations --- to try and avoid my recurring meltdowns and persistent depression. Keeping a journal is one of the first things my therapist suggested, so here I am.</p>
<p>I think the goal of this exercise is for me to learn to introspect and express my emotions, which is something I&#39;ve always struggled with. By honing this skill, maybe it will become easier for me to relate to other people&#39;s emotional landscapes.</p>
<p>As always, I remain skeptical and cautious, I don&#39;t want to get my hopes up unrealistically only to have them crushed later on. I&#39;ve been down that road too many times already.</p>
<p>So, in brief, here it is: the first post in, hopefully, an ongoing series. And if it turns out not to help, at least I&#39;m getting some typing and writing practice; I&#39;ve always admired writers ðŸ˜…</p>

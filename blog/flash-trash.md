> "If you only have one; you have _none_"

I wish I had taken this data security proverb more seriously a few years ago when the hard drive containing the only copy of most of my personal files became unreadable.

Thankfully, it wasn't a huge loss. The disk didn't contain [bitcoins](https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/15/uk/bitcoin-trash-landfill-gbr-scli-intl/index.html) worth millions or the only existing copy of my non-existent literary masterpiece. From what I can remember, it was mostly music, pictures and movies gleaned from the internet. One loss I did bemoan, however, was the totality of programs I had written as a teenager and in my early twenties.

I had a few phases back then, when I worked on little coding experiments in Flash and later Processing. My main interest was "generative art". I would spend hours working on little demos in the spirit of what can be found today on sites like [openprocessing.org](https://openprocessing.org/browse/). I'm not sure how many of these I had, probably no more than a hundred. I think most of them must have been trash, but I'm sure a handful were at least mildly interesting.

I had concluded that all of these were irretrievable lost until last Friday when I salvaged some dusty CDs from my childhood home. Based on sharpie'd titles on the disks, some of them contained backups of my Flash sketches from 2005 -- when I was 17 ðŸ˜². I wasn't sure if the data would still be readable, but lo and behold, I popped one of the discs into a USB disk reader and all the files were right there!

It wasn't everything, sadly, only the early Flash stuff when I was only just starting to dabble in programming; none of the later -- and more interesting -- Processing experiments. Maybe those will turn up at some point too...

Opening the files was a breeze. Although Adobe Flash -- once the ubiquitous go-to for animations on the web -- is a totally obsolete technology nowadays (persistent security flaws and the release of HTML5 and the \<canvas\> context sent Flash to the dustbin of history), a quick search turned up multiple on- and offline Flash emulators written in a variety of languages.

I started teaching myself programming when the 2020 pandemic made my
previous project -- giving painting and drawing lessons -- impossible.

Some of the work I am at least moderately satisfied with is listed here
and can also be found in my [github](https://www.github.com/nilueps)
repositories.

### Projects

The following include both personal and commissioned works.

#### Sources

The goal of this project is to provide community-driven tool that attempts to make explicit the relationship between *truth claims* and the respective *evidence* (or lack thereof) which supports them by establishing sets of *socially determined truth criteria*.

My hope is that such a tool could be used to validate or invalidate claims in fields where evidence is easily manipulated, obscured or omitted such as in the social sciences, the news, etc. Tackling historical revisionism was the original impetus for this project.

I am still working on a proof of concept.

#### nilueps.net

I built this website using a minimal toolset: no framework, just a few files bundled with [parcel](https://parceljs.org). I\'m toying with the idea of writing my own static site generator to allow for easy and consistent content management with zero bloat.

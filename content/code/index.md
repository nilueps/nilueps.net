- [repo](https://github.com/mappingpoll)


### Knowledge Sources

The goal of this project is to provide community-driven tool that attempts to make explicit the relationship between *truth claims* and the respective *evidence* (or lack thereof) which supports them by establishing sets of *socially determined truth criteria*.

My hope is that such a tool could be used to validate or invalidate claims in fields where evidence is easily manipulated, obscured or omitted such as in the social sciences, the news, etc. Tackling historical revisionism was the original impetus for this project.

I am still working on a proof of concept.

### Web Goban

A multiplayer go client in the browser.\
Still at in the planning phase for now.
